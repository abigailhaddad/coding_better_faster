# Better Development Practices with LLMs

**Clean code** is code that is easy to read, understand, and modify. It adheres to best practices that make it more maintainable, scalable, and error-resistant. In this workshop, we’ll leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to transform 'runnable' code into clean, maintainable code. By focusing on version control, documentation, and code refactoring, we'll ensure your code is ready for collaboration and future development, whether you’re working in Python or R.

## Target Audience

This workshop is for participants who:

* Are comfortable writing Python or R code to solve data problems like reading files, aggregating data, and creating visualizations.
* Want to enhance their code quality by moving beyond "code that runs" to "code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend" through clean code practices such as documentation, refactoring, and version control.
* Are interested in learning how to use LLMs like chatGPT to accelerate the process of writing and maintaining clean code.

## What's Changing, What's Not

While the specific LLMs we use and the ways we access them (e.g., browser-based vs. IDE integration) are evolving, clean coding principles remain constant:

* Good coding practices prioritize readability, maintainability, and modularity, which make your code easier to understand and less error-prone.
* LLMs can assist in writing cleaner code faster, but you still need to apply oversight and ensure the results align with your goals.

## Workshop Notes

This is an interactive workshop. Please bring a laptop and ensure the following are installed ahead of time:

* The latest version of Python or R, along with an IDE (e.g., VS Code, RStudio).
* Docker installed and configured on your system.
* Git installed and an account on GitHub.
* Access to a Large Language Model, such as signing up for OpenAI or Anthropic.

We’ll be working with both Python and R in the exercises, so familiarity with either language is sufficient.
